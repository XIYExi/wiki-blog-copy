## Definition

<TextHighlight>HTML entities is unavailable in CSS</TextHighlight>. To display
any HTML entities in CSS, we need to use CSS Entities.

The code doesn't work below because of using HTML Entity:

```css {2}
h2:after {
  content: "&#36;";
}
```

## Syntax

```css {2}
h2:after {
  content: "\0024"; /* \0024 is $ */
}
```
